# Applied Data Science Capstone Project

This repository contains the capstone project developed as part of the final course in the "IBM Data Science" specialization on Coursera, titled "Applied Data Science Capstone". This project represents the culmination of the knowledge and skills acquired throughout the specialization, where data science techniques are applied to solve a real-world problem.

## Project Description

This capstone project course offers a practical experience resembling the challenges data scientists encounter when dealing with real-world datasets. Participants will take on the role of a Data Scientist working for a startup aiming to rival SpaceX. Throughout the project, they will follow the Data Science methodology, which involves data collection, data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, model development, model evaluation, and presenting findings to stakeholders.

The primary objective is to predict the success of the first stage landing of SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket. SpaceX promotes Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website at a cost of 62 million dollars, significantly lower than other providers, which charge upwards of 165 million dollars per launch. This cost reduction is largely attributed to SpaceX's ability to reuse the first stage of the rocket.

By accurately predicting the probability of a successful first stage landing, it becomes possible to estimate the cost of a launch. Armed with the insights and models derived from Data Science analysis, the startup we are representing can make well-informed competitive bids against SpaceX for rocket launches.
